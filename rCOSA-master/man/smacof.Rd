\usage{
smacof(
  D,
  niter = 100,
  interc = 1,
  inicon = NULL,
  groupnr = NULL,
  colv = palette()[c(8, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1)],

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{dissimilarities/distances of class dist.}

\item{niter}{max number of iterations to use, default is set to 20: 'to iterate is heaven, to converge is divine'. Convergence does not necessarily give you the best non-linear mapping of the dissimilarity structure.}

\item{interc}{logical for including an additive constant in the smacof algorithm.}

\item{inicon}{intial configuration. By default this is specified as NULL, here the SMACOF algorithm specifies...}

\item{groupnr}{groupnr when known, each object can be given a number to which group it belongs}

\item{colv}{vector containing color names for each group number}

\item{main}{title of the plot, by default there is no title.}

\item{k}{number of dimensions}

\item{pch}{plotting 'character', i.e. symbol to use. This can either be a single character or an integer code for one of a set of graphics symbols. The full set of S symbols is available with \code{pch = 0:18}. For more information see the help file of the function \code{\link[graphics]{points}}.}

\item{PLOT}{whether to plot or not to plot, by default TRUE.}

\item{VERBOSE}{whether to give a stdout on the criterion for each iteration, by default set to equal TRUE.}

\item{...}{arguments which can be parsed to either the \code{\link[stats]{hclust}} or \code{\link[stats]{cmdscale}} procedures.}
}
\value{
Similar output as \code{\link[stats]{cmdscale}}

\description{
A metric multidimensional scaling algorithm that minimizes a least squares loss function based on the dissimilarities Heiser \& De Leeuw, 80 and 77; Gutman 68). The lettters in SMACOF stand for Scaling by MAjorizing a COmplicated Function.
