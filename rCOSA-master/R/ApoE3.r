#' A Typical Synthetic Data Set from a COSA Model

#' ApoE3 stands for Apolipoprotein E3. It is (one of many apolipoproteins) that, together with lipids, form lipoproteins (cholesterol particles), e.g. LDL, VLDL, and HDL. The E3 ``Leiden" is a human variant of ApoE3. When the lipoprotein is no longer recognized by special receptors in the liver, it prevents uptake of LDL cholersterol by the liver, and this results in strongly increased lipoprotein levels in the plasma. Eventually the latter condition results in atherosclerosis, which is hardening of the arteries. This may lead to blocked blood vessels and a stroke or a a heart attack.

#' The objects in the experiment from which we will analyze the data are mice: we have a number of normal mice (called wildtype), and a set of experimental, transgenic mice, which contain the Human Leiden ApoE3 variety. On a high fat diet the mice develop severe atherosclerosis. In this study the mice were on a low fat diet. Other important features of the study are that the samples were collected at the age of 9 weeks, while atherosclerosis is manifest after 20 weeks, and that big changes in metabolite profiles were not expected. The data are from LC-MS (mass spectrometry) analysis of plasma lipids, and consist of 1550 measurements (attributes) on 38 cases (consisting of two observations for each mouse). The original experiment was performed with 10 wildtype and 10 transgenic mice, but only 9 transgenic mice survived the experiment.
