\title{featurefilter: A function for filtering features}
\usage{
featurefilter(mydata, percentile = 10, method = "MAD", topN = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{Data frame: should have samples as columns and rows as features}

\item{percentile}{Numerical value: the top X percent most variable features should be kept}

\item{method}{Character vector: variance (var), coefficient of variation (A), second order A (A2), median absolute deviation (MAD)}

\item{topN}{Numerical value: the number of most variable features to display}
}
\value{
A list, containing: 
1) filtered data
2) statistics for each feature order according to the defined filtering metric
}
\description{
This function is to filter features based on variance. Depending on the data different
metrics will be more appropiate, simple variance is included if variance does not tend to
increase with the mean. There is also the median absolute deviation which is a more robust
metric than variance, this is preferable. The coefficient of variation (A) or its second
order derivative (A2) (Kvalseth, 2017) are also included which standardise the standard
deviation with respect to the mean. It is best to manually examine the mean-variance relationship of 
the data, for example, using the results from this function together with the qplot function 
from ggplot2.
